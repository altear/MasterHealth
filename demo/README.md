# Notes for Sadiq
A minimal demo site

I'm using
- bootstrap-react: provides a lot of styles (that are easy to overwrite). Also components like the navbar.
- react-router-dom: handles routing in app.js
- sass (or scss): this is the css enhancement that I was talking about. Here's the [site](https://sass-lang.com/).
